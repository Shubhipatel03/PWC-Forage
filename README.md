# PWC-Forage
The PWC Job Simulation Forage project aims to simulate real-world job tasks for analyzing and visualizing business data using Power BI. This project focuses on three key datasets: Call Center, Churn, and Diversity &amp; Inclusion. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, we provide insights and visualizations that support data-driven decision-making.
